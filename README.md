# Sorting Algorithms Test
## This is for a school project.   
This project includes implementations for the selection, bubble, merge, heap and merge sort algorithms. I have tested the preformance of every algorithm, and later in the README I will explain the time complexity for each of the algorithms individually.

| Algorithm | Elements Sorted | Time (s) |
| --------- | :--------------:| --------:|
| Selection |    100000       |    23.8  |
|   Bubble  |    100000       |    58.2  |
| Partition |    100000       |    0.04  |
|   Merge   |    100000       |    0.04  |
|   Quick   |    100000       |     0.03 |
|    Heap   |    100000       |     53.2 |
